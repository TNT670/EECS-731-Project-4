# EECS-731-Project-4

I utilize polynomial regression in this project to predict the next scores of a particular NFL team. The Jupyter notebook in the notebooks directory contains a detailed description of the actions taken and analysis.

The regression program can be found in the src directory. This is a Python 3 script that uses Scikit and Pandas and can be interacted with. Run it with command line arguments, the first being the abbreviation of the football team and the second being the nth game to predict the score of. For example:

    python3 nfl_regression.py CHI 4
